README

This program takes a story as input, formatted with key words missing (ex: <noun>) and requests these
words from Mechanical Turk workers. It takes those results and asks more "turkers" to select their
favorite option for that blank.  The final reaults are then placed back into the original story
in the appropriate spots to create a Mad Libs story line!


--As it is, you must have the story_beg.txt and story_end.txt files in the directory with TurkLibs.py

To run:
python TurkLibs.py
