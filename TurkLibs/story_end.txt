Rain beat against the Black Ops <vehicle> as it sped through the night.  Commander in Chief, Cav,
looked out the window, mentally preparing for the mission at hand: to assassinate the deadliest terrorist in
 the world, <celeb1> .  Cav was accompanied by his most trusted team of soldiers, <celeb2> , <celeb3> , and <celeb4> .
The drop off point had finally arrived.. One by one the team <adverb1> <verb1> out of the chopper.
Cav was last, but just before exiting, he <past_tense_verb1> his lucky <obj1> .  The black ops squad had
planned a surprise attack on <celeb1> 's super secret <type_of_residence> , that was disguised as a <store_name> . 
As the squad approached the <type_of_residence> , a loud <sound> sounded and <celeb2> was hit in the <body_part1>
with a/an <obj2> .  Sadly, he died on impact.  Knowing they had to act fast, Cav yelled " <statement1> ", and the 
squad <past_tense_verb1> towards the <type_of_residence> , nearly missing heavy gun fire.  Waiting for them at the
entrance were two <animal1> holding <melee_weapon> .  <celeb3> , yielding a/an <obj3> , was able to take down one
of them while the other snuck up behind him, snapping his <body_part2> , silencing him forever.  Cav, feeling
confident after watching <movie_title> six times the previous night, shot the <animal1> between the <body_part_pair1>
and watched him drop to the floor with a sickening thud.  Cav and <celeb4> finally entered the <type_of_residence> , not
knowing what horrors awaited them.  Cav was worried about <celeb4> 's ability to fight since he lost both <body_part_pair2>
in an ugly <board_game> accident a few years back.  The <type_of_residence> was so silent you could hear a/an <obj4> drop. 
All of a sudden from the shadows emerged robots with <celeb5> faces.  Cav reflected beck on his training, remembering
he had learned how to <verb2> <adverb2> and that he had written a Python program that could count <countable> .  It <adverb3>
dawned on Cav exactly how useless his training was and that he wasn't prepared for this situation at all.
After a fierce battle with the robots, Cav noticed that <celeb4> had been stabbed with a/an <obj5> , and was losing blood
at an alarming rate.  Cav had no choice but to hold <celeb4> , tears <verb3> down his face.  <celeb4> looked at Cav
and whispered his last words, " <statement2> ".  Cav, being the lone surviving member of the squad, continued down the hall to
the last door.  Cav <past_tense_verb2> into the room and knew immediately he found the room containing <celeb1> , for it stank
of <adjective> <obj6> (s).  A large chair in the middle of the room spun around.  In it sat <celeb1> , stroking a/an <obj7> .
"I've been expecting...", <celeb1> began, but before they could utter another sound, Cav shot <celeb1> <number>
times in the <body_part3> with a/an <obj8> .  Cav had done it!!! He had assassinated <celeb1> and avenged his fallen brothers.
Cav was awarded the Medal of <abstract_noun> upon his arrival home.  He then retired from service and lived out the rest
of his days <verb_ending_in_ing> his <animal_plural> .

THE END
