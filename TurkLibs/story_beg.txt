Rain beat against the Black Ops <vehicle> as it sped through the night.  Commander in Chief, Cav,
looked out the window, mentally preparing for the mission at hand: to assassinate the deadliest terrorist in
 the world, <celebrity>.  Cav was accompanied by his most trusted team of soldiers, <celebrity>, <celebrity>, and <celebrity>.
The drop off point had finally arrived.. One by one the team <adverb><verb> out of the chopper.
Cav was last, but just before exiting, he <past-tense-verb> his lucky <object>.  The black ops squad had
planned a surprise attack on *celeb1*'s super secret <type-of-residence>, that was disguised as a <store-name>. 
As the squad approached the *type of residence*, a loud <sound> sounded and *celeb2* was hit in the <body-part>
with a/an <object>.  Sadly, he died on impact.  Knowing they had to act fast, Cav yelled "<statement>!", and the 
squad <past-tense-verb> towards the *type_of_residence*, nearly missing heavy gun fire.  Waiting for them at the
entrance were two <animal>s holding <melee-weapon>.  *celeb3*, yielding a/an <object>, was able to take down one
of them while the other snuck up behind him, snapping his <body-part>, silencing him forever.  Cav, feeling
confident after watching <movie-title> six times the previous night, shot the *animal* between the <part-of-the-body-that-there-is-two-of>
and watched him drop to the floor with a sickening thud.  Cav and *celeb4* finally entered the *type of residence*, not
knowing what horrors awaited them.  Cav was worried about *celeb4*'s ability to fight since he lost both <part-of-the-body-that-there-is-two-of>
in an ugly <board-game> accident a few years back.  The *type of residence* was so silent you could hear a/an <object> drop. 
All of a sudden from the shadows emerged robots with <celebrity> faces.  Cav reflected beck on his training, remembering
he had learned how to <verb><adverb> and that he had written a Python program that could count <something-you-count>.  It <adverb>
dawned on Cav exactly how useless his training was and that he wasn't prepared for this situation at all.
After a fierce battle with the robots, Cav noticed that *celeb4* had been stabbed with a/an <object>, and was losing blood
at an alarming rate.  Cav had no choice but to hold *celeb4*, tears <verb> down his face.  *celeb4* looked at Cav
and whispered his last words, "<statement>".  Cav, being the lone surviving member of the squad, continued down the hall to
the last door.  Cav <past-tense-verb> into the room and knew immediately he found the room containing *celeb1*, for it stank
of <adjective><object>s.  A large chair in the middle of the room spun around.  In it sat *celeb1*, stroking a/an<object>.
"I've been expecting...", *celeb1* began, but before they could utter another sound, Cav shot *celeb1*<a-number-between-2-100>
times in the <body-part> with a/an <object>.  Cav had done it!!! He had assassinated *celeb1* and avenged his fallen brothers.
Cav was awarded the Medal of <abstract-noun> upon his arrival home.  He then retired from service and lived out the rest
of his days <verb-ending-with-ing> his <animal-plural>.

THE END
